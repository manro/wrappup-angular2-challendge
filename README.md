# angular2-webpack-boilerplate

**Note: This guide is simplified code change of following the Angular's [Angular2-Webpack](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack).**

A complete, yet simple, starter for Angular 2 using Webpack.

This seed repo serves as an Angular 2 starter for anyone looking to get up and running with Angular 2 and TypeScript fast. Using [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for building our files and assisting with boilerplate. 
* Modules files organization for [Angular 2](https://angular.io/).
* Ready to go build system using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/) for working with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* Stylesheets with [LASS](http://less-lang.com/) (not required, it supports regular css too).
* Error reported with [TSLint](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer).
* Documentation with [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.io/).

>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM

### Quick start

> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.ts` inside [`/src/app/app.component.ts`](/src/app/app.component.ts)

# Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v5.x.x`+) and NPM (`3.x.x`+)

## Installing

* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Developing

After you have installed all dependencies you can now start developing with:

* `npm start`

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The application can be checked at `http://localhost:7070`.

As an alternative, you can work using Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

* `npm run start:hmr`

And you are all set! You can now modify your components on the fly without having to reload the entire page.

## Production

To build your application, run:

* `npm run build`

You can now go to `/dist` and deploy that to your server!

## Documentation

You can generate api docs (using [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.io/)) for your code with the following:

* `npm run docs`

# FAQ

#### Do I need to add script / link tags into index.html ?

No, Webpack will add all the needed Javascript bundles as script tags and all the CSS files as link tags. The advantage is that you don't need to modify the index.html every time you build your solution to update the hashes.

#### How to include external angular 2 libraries ?

It's simple, just install the lib via npm and import it in your code when you need it. Don't forget that you need to configure some external libs in the [bootstrap](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/main.ts) of your application.

#### How to include external css files such as bootstrap.css ?

Just install the lib and import the css files in [vendor.ts](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/vendor.ts). For example this is how to do it with bootstrap:

```sh
npm install bootstrap@next --save
```

And in [vendor.ts](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/vendor.ts) add the following:

```ts
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```

# TypeScript

> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor

We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 11+](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)
